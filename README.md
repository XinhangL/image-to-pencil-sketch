# üñºÔ∏è Image to Pencil Sketch with OpenCV

This project transforms a colored image into a pencil sketch using basic image processing techniques with OpenCV in Python. It's designed as a simple, visual data project ideal for portfolio or educational use.

This project is inspired by a StrataScratch problem. The image is not included due to licensing restrictions, however, I got a photo of my cute dog Mia that I can use on this!

Originally inspired by a data science internship assignment from LetGrowMore (LGM).

## üìå Project Objective

Given a colored JPEG image, simulate a pencil sketch using the following steps:
1. Convert the image to grayscale
2. Invert the grayscale image
3. Apply Gaussian blur to the inverted image
4. Invert the blurred image
5. Divide the grayscale image by the inverted blurred image to generate the sketch

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- Python 3.11
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV (`opencv-python-headless`)
- Matplotlib (for display)
